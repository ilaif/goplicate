---

Goplicate is a CLI tool that helps define common code or configuration snippets once and sync them to multiple projects.

## Why and how

In cases where we have many snippets that are repeated between different repositories or projects, it becomes a real hassle to keep them up-to-date.

We want to stay [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

Goplicate achieves that by defining "blocks" around such shared snippets and automates their update via a shared source that contains the most up-to-date version of those snippets.

## Installation

### MacOS

```sh
brew install ilaif/tap/goplicate
brew upgrade ilaif/tap/goplicate
```

### Install from source

```sh
go install github.com/ilaif/goplicate/cmd/goplicate@latest
```

## Usage

`goplicate --help`

## Design principles

* üåµ Stay [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) - Write a configuration once, and have it synced across many projects.
* ü§§ [Keep It Stupid Simple (KISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - Treat configuration snippets as simple text, not assuming anything about structure.
* üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Allow flexibility, but not too much - Allow syncing whole files, or parts of them (currently, line-based).
* üòé Automate all the things - After an initial configuration, automates the rest.

## Features

* Configure line-based blocks that should be synced across multiple projects and files.
* See comfortable diffs while updating config files.
* Template support using [Go Templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) with dynamic parameters or conditions.
* Sync multiple repositories with a single command.
* Automatically run post hooks to validate that the updates worked well before opening a pull request.
* Open a GitHub Pull Request (assuming [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is installed and configured).

## Example

Let's say that we have a common configuration that we need to maintain for multiple projects. In this example, we'll use an `.eslintrc.js`:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a config file that some of its contents are copied across multiple projects:

`.eslintrc.js`:

```txt
module.exports = {
    "extends": "eslint:recommended",
    "rules": {
        // enable additional rules
        "indent": ["error", 4],
        "linebreak-style": ["error", "unix"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"],
        "semi": ["error", "always"],

        // override configuration set by extending "eslint:recommended"
        "no-empty": "warn",
        "no-cond-assign": ["error", "always"],
    }
}
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add goplicate block comments for the `common-rules` synced snippet:

```diff
module.exports = {
    "extends": "eslint:recommended",
    "rules": {
+       // goplicate-start:common-rules
        // enable additional rules
        "indent": ["error", 2],
        "linebreak-style": ["error", "unix"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"],
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
+       // goplicate-end:common-rules

        // override configuration set by extending "eslint:recommended"
        "no-empty": "warn",
        "no-cond-assign": ["error", "always"],
    }
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a separate, centralized repository to manage all of the shared config files. We'll name it `goplicate` and add a base `.eslintrc.js.tpl` file with the `common-rules` snippet that we want to sync:

```js
// goplicate-start:common-rules
// enable additional rules
"indent": ["error", 4],
"linebreak-style": ["error", "unix"],
"quotes": ["error", "double"],
"semi": ["error", "always"],
// goplicate-end:common-rules
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Go back to the original project, and create a `.goplicate.yaml` file in your project root folder:

```yaml
targets:
  - path: .eslintrc.js
    source: ../goplicate/.eslintrc.js.tpl
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Finally, run goplicate on the repository to sync any updates:
